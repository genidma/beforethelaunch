Primary goal: The idea is to help facilitate quality connections on a 1:1 basis. 

Secondary goal: Predict the outcome via a recommendation engine. The recommendations, themselves will have a confidence score attached to them (x). For example: It is recommended that George should connect with Simone and there is a 60% confidence score (or higher) that this connection should last for (y) duration. (The reasons (z) may or may not be cited)

Method/Core dependency: 
- Pre-launch/during launch: Starting an on-going dialouge with entrepreners in order to validate market/need. 
- Feature Product in the core dependency area: Validate identit(ies)y, create rich profiles and take security really really seriously.

The problem: What should be categorized as a 'quality connection' is subjective.

Potential workaround/triangulating to a solution. 1) Some kind of an agent that is continually checking in with the user. 2) Go deeper and as it relates to understanding intent. 3) Using results from the first two steps, get to (x).

Core feature: Reputation scores. The reputation scores will mostly be powered by the feedback that users will leave for each other. With mechanisms in place to: 1) Deter/deny manipulative practices. 2) " " artificially inflating one's score or someone's else's.

Note: I haven't thought about making use of emotion AI here just yet. Although this is a space that I did explore with my previous startup and I think it would be useful for a lot of different needs.

Again, the core goal is to enable quality connections and get paid customers from Day 1 of being launch. Data will never be sold. (zero exceptions)

Is this something you'd be interested in being a part of? If so, please let me know.
